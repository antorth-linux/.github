# About Antorth Linux

This organization is home to a collection of software repositories that eventually will be incorporated into a desktop environment, and then perhaps yet another distribution.

There are several important objectives for this collection of projects:

1. All applications should be feature-complete replacements for their alternatives.
  - Problems that have pre-existing (and satisfactory) solutions should be used, to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
2. Applications developed within this organization should be the best available option in their class, and be well designed and as bug-free as humanly possible.
  - We will create quality software at all costs, including and especially time.
3. All software published by this organization will be free and open source, with a recognized FOSS license.
4. Software should be portable, and unless the functionality is specific to another project by this organization, should work across the majority of the major Linux distributions.
  - Applications should also work on macOS and Windows, if appliccable, though this is not a priority.
5. All software developed by and within this organization should be maintained and supported, as long as it is relevant to either the developer(s) or the community.

## What does "Antorth" mean?

The name, Antorth, is a portmanteau of the contraction "anti-orthodox". The name was chosen with the simple idea that some of the best products were created out of inexperience.

That may be confusing.

Most of the software we see today is a remix or reimplimentation of a predecessor. I have personally not noticed much significant innovation in the world of computer software, and I seek to change this.
Rather than reusing old concepts and methods to solve equally old problems, one should not be afraid to seek a better solution, especialy when a better solution, or a modification of a previous solution, could result in better integration between itself and other software. Having an operating system that is seamlessly integrated with every other part of itself is crucial for creating a viable product for less-knowledgable or non-technical oriented end-users.
Currently Apple is king when it comes to this. Linux, or "GNU Plus Linux" if you rather, falls very far short of being a usable option for the average individual. There have been several attempts at solutions, mostly made by large entities such as Canonical, but they fail at making their platform an attractive alternative to proprietary and closed-source options. This is largely due to the fact that they offer nothing that the competitors have not already accomplished, as far as a typical computer owner is concerned. Additionally, there is an added level of difficulty caused by the necessity for migrant users to adapt to and learn from a new system as they attempt to use it.
